# YOU TUBE CLONE

# Project Summary

I Avinash Gupta Software Intern at Mavonic have created this project under assistance of mavonic team and with the help of my mentor Arjun Naiyak.

In this project I have created the simplest youtube clone UI with responsive design , and i have created this using tech-HTML and CSS.

With the help of html i have created the structure of the web and with the help of css i have provided design to my project with good responsiveness. I have attached the css file to it and have also used API to use different font in my project.
I have also attached a feature so that video can be played and the thumbnails of vidoes are shown in that page.

Thank You
